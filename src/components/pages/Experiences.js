            <h3>Lifeguard 2015-2018</h3>
            <p>
                I have been qualified to work as a lifeguard at BÃ¸ Sommarland each summer
                for almost half a decade, during which I received special training in first aid,
                radio communications, and rescue. Over the course of my lifeguard career I have rescued
                more than 20 adults and children. I have earned two internal awards in areas I have excelled at,
                which were productivity and team-work. I have learned how to work with other lifeguards through
                radio communications, and general team-work during any rescue.
